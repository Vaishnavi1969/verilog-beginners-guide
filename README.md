# Verilog Guide for Beginners

This repository contains a beginner-friendly Verilog HDL guide focused on understanding structural and behavioral modeling styles. The examples are designed to help new learners grasp digital design concepts through hands-on coding.

This guide was created as part of my VLSI internship, with valuable support from my mentor and academic guidance from Dr. S.S. Vincely, Dean, Arunachala College of Engineering for Women.


## What This Repository Contains

This collection includes Verilog programs written using **structural and behavioral modeling** for:

- **Logic Gates** – AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR
- **Registers** – 4-bit register modules and flip-flop-based designs
- **Code Converters** – Binary to Gray, Gray to Binary

Each module is created to reflect either a gate-level (structural) or high-level procedural (behavioral) approach, making it easier to compare both styles.
